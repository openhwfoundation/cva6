CVA6 is a 6-stage, single-issue, in-order CPU which implements the 64-bit RISC-V instruction set. It fully implements I, M, A and C extensions as specified in Volume I: User-Level ISA V 2.3 as well as the draft privilege extension 1.10. It implements three privilege levels M, S, U to fully support a Unix-like operating system. Furthermore, it is compliant to the draft external debug spec 0.13.

It has a configurable size, separate TLBs, a hardware PTW and branch-prediction (branch target buffer and branch history table). The primary design goal was on reducing critical path length.

# CVA6 Target Configurations

CVA6 supports multiple processor variants (targets), each defining a specific configuration with ISA extensions, memory maps, and RTL parameters. Each target is located in `config/target/<target_name>/` and contains configuration files for compilation, simulation, and verification.

For detailed information on available targets, configuration file formats, and how to create new targets, see [config/README.md](config/README.md).

# Quick Start

#### cook.py

`cook.py` is a Python-based command runner that provides a unified interface for CVA6 workflows including software compilation, RTL simulation with multiple simulators (VCS, Xcelium, Questa), synthesis, and analysis.

**Quick Start Example:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6.git
cd cva6

# Install Python dependencies (use pip3 if pip is not available)
pip3 install --user -r flows/requirements.txt
# Note: --user installs packages to ~/.local/lib/python*/site-packages
# Ensure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH for black and pylint commands
# Or, to keep them out of the home directory, in a virtual environment:
#   python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
#   pip3 install -r flows/requirements.txt

# Initialize submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install Spike ISA simulator (requires: gcc, g++, device-tree-compiler, libboost-dev)
# See verif/regress/install-spike.sh for details
(cd verif/regress && source ./install-spike.sh)

# Configure your environment (adapt to your setup)
# Edit flows/config/setenv.sh - Set paths to your CAD tools (VCS, Xcelium, Questa, etc.)
# Edit flows/config/compiler.yml - Set your RISC-V toolchain paths (GCC or LLVM)
# Edit flows/config/techno.yml - Set your ASIC library paths (optional, for synthesis)
source flows/config/setenv.sh

# Optional: Verify your setup
./cook.py self-check
# Optional: Enable shell autocompletion for cook.py commands
./cook.py --install-completion
# Optional: Get help on available commands
./cook.py --help

./cook.py questa-uvm-run --target cv32a60x --testname hello-world
```

**For complete documentation**, see [flows/README.md](flows/README.md)

# Old Quick setup

The following instructions will allow you to compile and run a Verilator model of the CVA6 APU (which instantiates the CVA6 core) within the CVA6 APU testbench (corev_apu/tb).

Throughout all build and simulations scripts executions, you can use the environment variable `NUM_JOBS` to set the number of concurrent jobs launched by `make`:
- if left undefined, `NUM_JOBS` will default to 1, resulting in a sequential execution
of `make` jobs;
- when setting `NUM_JOBS` to an explicit value, it is recommended not to exceed 2/3 of
the total number of virtual cores available on your system.

1. Checkout the repository and initialize all submodules.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6.git
cd cva6
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Install the GCC Toolchain [build prerequisites](util/toolchain-builder/README.md#Prerequisites) then [the toolchain itself](util/toolchain-builder/README.md#Getting-started).

:warning: It is **strongly recommended** to use the toolchain built with the provided scripts.

3. Install `cmake`, version 3.14 or higher.

4. Set the RISCV environment variable.
```sh
export RISCV=/path/to/toolchain/installation/directory
```

5. Install `help2man` and `device-tree-compiler` packages.

For Debian-based Linux distributions, run :

```sh
sudo apt-get install help2man device-tree-compiler
```

6. Install the riscv-dv requirements:

```sh
pip3 install -r verif/sim/dv/requirements.txt
```

7. Run these commands to install a custom Spike and Verilator (i.e. these versions must be used to simulate the CVA6) and [these](#running-regression-tests-simulations) tests suites.
```sh
# DV_SIMULATORS is detailed in the next section
export DV_SIMULATORS=veri-testharness,spike
bash verif/regress/smoke-tests.sh
```

# Running standalone simulations

Simulating the CVA6 is done by using `verif/sim/cva6.py`.

* **[Running Simulations](tutorials/running_sim.md)**
* **[ASIC Implementation](tutorials/asic.md)**
* **[FPGA Implementation and running an OS](tutorials/fpga.md)**
* **[Instruction Tracing](corev_apu/instr_tracing/README.md)**

# Running regression tests simulations

The smoke-tests script installs a random instruction generator and several tests suites:
- [riscv-dv](https://github.com/chipsalliance/riscv-dv)
- [riscv-compliance](https://github.com/lowRISC/riscv-compliance)
- [riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests)
- [riscv-arch-test](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test)


The regression tests are done by comparing a model simulation trace with the Spike trace.

Several tests scripts can be found in `./verif/regress`

For example, here is how would run the riscv-arch-test regression test suite with the Verilator model:

```sh
export DV_SIMULATORS=veri-testharness,spike
bash verif/regress/dv-riscv-arch-test.sh
```


# Logs

The logs from cva6.py are located in `./verif/sim/out_YEAR-MONTH-DAY`.

Assuming you ran the smoke-tests scripts in the previous step, here is the log directory hierarchy:

- **directed_asm_tests/**: The compiled (to .o then .bin) assembly tests
- **directed_c_tests/**: The compiled (to .o then .bin) c tests
- **spike_sim/**: Spike simulation log and trace files
- **veri_testharness_sim**: Verilator simulation log and trace files
- **iss_regr.log**: The regression test log

The regression test log summarizes the comparison between the simulator trace and the Spike trace. Beware that a if a test fails before the comparison step, it will not appear in this log, check the output of cva6.py and the logs of the simulation instead.


# Waveform generation

Waveform generation is currently supported for Verilator (`veri-testharness`)
and VCS with full UVM testbench (`vcs-uvm`) simulation types.  It is disabled
by default to save simulation time and storage space.

To enable waveform generation for a supported simulation mode, set either
of the two shell variables that control tracing before running any of the
test scripts under `verif/regress`:
- `export TRACE_FAST=1` enables "fast" waveform generation (keep simulation
   time low at the expense of space).  This will produce VCD files when using
   Verilator, and VPD files when using Synopsys VCS with UVM testbench (`vcs-uvm`).
- `export TRACE_COMPACT=1` enables "compact" waveform generation (keep waveform
   files smaller at the expense of increased simulation time).  This will
   produce FST files when using Verilator, and FSDB files when using Synopsys
   VCS with UVM testbench (`vcs-uvm`).

To generate VCD waveforms of the `smoke-tests` regression suite using Verilator, use:
```sh
export DV_SIMULATORS=veri-testharness,spike
export TRACE_FAST=1
bash verif/regress/smoke-tests-<cpu_version>.sh
```

Where `<cpu_version>` is one of the following, depending on the CPU variant you want to use.
- `cv32a65x`.
- `cv32a6_imac_sv32`.
- `cv64a6_imafdc_sv39`.

After each simulation run involving Verilator or VCS, the generated waveforms
will be copied  to the directory containing the log files (see above,) with
the name of the current HW configuration added to the file name right before
the file type suffix (e.g., `I-ADD-01.cv32a60x.vcd`).

# COREV-APU FPGA Emulation

We currently provide support for the [Genesys 2 board](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/genesys-2/reference-manual) and the [Agilex 7 Development Kit](https://www.intel.la/content/www/xl/es/products/details/fpga/development-kits/agilex/agf014.html).

- **Genesys 2**

    We provide pre-build bitstream and memory configuration files for the Genesys 2 [here](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/releases).

    Tested on Vivado 2018.2. The FPGA currently contains the following peripherals:

   - DDR3 memory controller
   - SPI controller to conncet to an SDCard
   - Ethernet controller
   - JTAG port (see debugging section below)
   - Bootrom containing zero stage bootloader and device tree.
   - UART
   - GPIOs connected to LEDs

> The ethernet controller and the corresponding network connection is still work in progress and not functional at the moment. Expect some updates soon-ish.

- **Agilex 7**

   Tested on Quartus Prime Version 24.1.0 Pro Edition. The FPGA currently contains the following peripherals:

   - DDR4 memory controller
   - JTAG port (see debugging section below)
   - Bootrom containing zero stage bootloader
   - UART
   - GPIOs connected to LEDs

> The ethernet controller and the corresponding network connection, as well as the SD Card connection and the capability to boot linux are still work in progress and not functional at the moment. Expect some updates soon-ish.


## Programming the Memory Configuration File or bitstream

- **Genesys 2**

   - Open Vivado
   - Open the hardware manager and open the target board (Genesys II - `xc7k325t`)
   - Tools - Add Configuration Memory Device
   - Select the following Spansion SPI flash `s25fl256xxxxxx0`
   - Add `ariane_xilinx.mcs`
   - Press Ok. Flashing will take a couple of minutes.
   - Right click on the FPGA device - Boot from Configuration Memory Device (or press the program button on the FPGA)

- **Agilex 7**

   - Open Quartus programmer
   - Configure HW Setup by selecting the AGF FPGA Development Kit
   - Click Auto-Detect to scan the JTAG chain
   - In the device list, right click over device AGFB014R24B and add file (.sof)
   - Click on Start button to program the FPGA
   - Right now only baremetal is supported, so right after programming you can connect to the UART and see your CVA6 alive on Agilex!
   - For this you need to use the JTAG UART provided with Quartus installation

```
.$quartus_installation_path/qprogrammer/quartus/bin/juart-terminal
juart-terminal: connected to hardware target using JTAG UART on cable
juart-terminal: "AGF FPGA Development Kit [1-3]", device 1, instance 0
juart-terminal: (Use the IDE stop button or Ctrl-C to terminate)

Hello World!
```

## Preparing the SD Card

The first stage bootloader will boot from SD Card by default. Get yourself a suitable SD Card (we use [this](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Digital-Mobility-MBLY10G2-32GB/dp/B00519BEQO) one). Either grab a pre-built Linux image from [here](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane-sdk/releases) or generate the Linux image yourself following the README in the [ariane-sdk repository](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane-sdk). Prepare the SD Card by following the "Booting from SD card" section in the ariane-sdk repository.

Connect a terminal to the USB serial device opened by the FTDI chip e.g.:
```
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

Default baudrate set by the bootlaoder and Linux is `115200`.

After you've inserted the SD Card and programmed the FPGA you can connect to the serial port of the FPGA and should see the bootloader and afterwards Linux booting. Default username is `root`, no password required.


## Generating a Bitstream

- **Genesys 2**

To generate the FPGA bitstream (and memory configuration) yourself for the Genesys II board run:

```
make fpga
```

This will produce a bitstream file and memory configuration file (in `fpga/work-fpga`) which you can permanently flash by running the above commands.

- **Agilex 7**

To generate the FPGA bitstream yourself for the Agilex 7 board run:

```
make altera
```

We recommend to set the parameter FpgaAlteraEn (and also FpgaEn) to benefit from the FPGA optimizations.

This will produce a bitstream file (in `altera/output_files`) which you can program following the previous instructions. **Note: Bear in mind that you need a Quartus Pro Licence to be able to generate this bitstream**

To clean the project after generating the bitstream, use

```
make clean-altera
```

## Debugging

- **Genesys 2**
You can debug (and program) the FPGA using [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/doc/html/Architecture-and-Core-Commands.html). We provide two example scripts for OpenOCD below.

To get started, connect the micro USB port that is labeled with JTAG to your machine. This port is attached to the FTDI 2232 USB-to-serial chip on the Genesys 2 board, and is usually used to access the native JTAG interface of the Kintex-7 FPGA (e.g. to program the device using Vivado). However, the FTDI chip also exposes a second serial link that is routed to GPIO pins on the FPGA, and we leverage this to wire up the JTAG from the RISC-V debug module.

>If you are on an Ubuntu based system you need to add the following udev rule to `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ftdi.rules`
>```
> SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6010", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"
>```

Once attached to your system, the FTDI chip should be listed when you type `lsusb`:

```
Bus 005 Device 019: ID 0403:6010 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT2232C/D/H Dual UART/FIFO IC
```

If this is the case, you can go on and start openocd with the `fpga/ariane.cfg` configuration file:

```
openocd -f fpga/ariane.cfg

- **Agilex 7**

You can debug (and program) the FPGA using a modified version of OpenOCD included with Quartus installation ($quartus_installation_path/qprogrammer/quartus/bin/openocd).

To get started, connect the micro USB port that is labeled with J13 to your machine. It is the same port that is used for the UART. Both use the JTAG interface and connect to the System Level Debugging (SLD) Hub instantiated inside the FPGA. Then the debugger connection goes to the virtual JTAG IP (vJTAG) which can be accessed with the modified version of OpenOCD.

You can start openocd with the `altera/cva6.cfg` configuration file:

## Preliminary Support for OpenPiton Cache System

CVA6 has preliminary support for the OpenPiton distributed cache system from Princeton University. To this end, a different L1 cache subsystem (`src/cache_subsystem/wt_cache_subsystem.sv`) has been developed that follows a write-through protocol and that has support for cache invalidations and atomics.

The corresponding integration patches will be released on [OpenPiton GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/openpiton). Check the `README` in that repository to see how to use CVA6 in the OpenPiton setting.

To activate the different cache system, compile your code with the macro `DCACHE_TYPE`.


## Re-generating the Bootcode (ZSBL)

The zero stage bootloader (ZSBL) for RTL simulation lives in `bootrom/` while the bootcode for the FPGA is in `fpga/src/bootrom`. The RTL bootcode simply jumps to the base of the DRAM where the FSBL takes over. For the FPGA the ZSBL performs additional housekeeping. Both bootloader pass the hartid as well as address to the device tree in argumen register `a0` and `a1` respectively.

To re-generate the bootcode you can use the existing makefile within those directories. To generate the SystemVerilog files you will need the `bitstring` python package installed on your system.


# Directory Structure:

The directory structure separates the [CVA6 RISC-V CPU](#cva6-risc-v-cpu) core from the [CORE-V-APU FPGA Emulation Platform](#corev-apu-fpga-emulation).
Files, directories and submodules under `cva6` are for the core _only_ and should not have any dependencies on the APU.
Files, directories and submodules under `corev_apu` are for the FPGA Emulation platform.
The CVA6 core can be compiled stand-alone, and obviously the APU is dependent on the core.

The top-level directories of this repo:
* **ci**: Scriptware for CI.
* **common**: Source code used by both the CVA6 Core and the COREV APU. Subdirectories from here are `local` for common files that are hosted in this repo and `submodules` that are hosted in other repos.
* **core**: Source code for the CVA6 Core only. There should be no sources in this directory used to build anything other than the CVA6 core.
* **corev_apu**: Source code for the CVA6 APU, exclusive of the CVA6 core. There should be no sources in this directory used to build the CVA6 core.
* **docs**: Documentation.
* **pd**: Example and CI scripts to synthesis CVA6.
* **util**: General utility scriptware.
* **vendor**: Third-party IP maintained outside the repository.
* **verif**: Verification environment for the CVA6. The verification files shared with other cores are in the [core-v-verif](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif) repository on GitHub. core-v-verif is defined as a cva6 submodule.


## verif Directories

- **bsp**:     board support package for test-programs compiled/assembled/linked for the CVA6.
This BSP is used by both `core` testbench and `uvmt_cva6` UVM verification environment.
- **regress**: scripts to install tools, test suites, CVA6 code and to execute tests
- **sim**:     simulation environment (e.g. riscv-dv)
- **tb**:      testbench module instancing the core
- **tests**:   source of test cases and test lists
